# Module 15 Challenge     

      In this challenge, we are developing a way to visualize USGS earthquake data that will educate the public and other government organizations. Here, we created an Interactive map with earthquake data. Each point displays the magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake. Data point colors change with the depth level.
