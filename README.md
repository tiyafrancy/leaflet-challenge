# Module 15 Challenge     

      In this challenge, we are developing a way to visualize USGS earthquake data that will educate the public and other government organizations. Here, we created an Interactive map with earthquake data. Each point displays the magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake. Data point colors change with the depth level.    

           This is the URL we used to explore the geoJSON data : https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

                  Data markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
